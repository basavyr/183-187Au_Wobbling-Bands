# Wobbling excitations in $^{183-187}$Au

A project that aims at calculating the wobbling energies for $^{183,187}$Au isotopes using a semi-classical approach based on Signature and Parity symmetries. Agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data is the major goal of the implementation.

## Workflow

Programming languages used for the development:
* Wolfram Mathematica
